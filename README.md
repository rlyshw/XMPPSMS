XMPPSMS
=======
Android app!
Text to/from your computer

This works by registering your phone number as a user on my XMPP server (rlyshw.com)

Example: if your phone number is 555-676-1234, your user on the XMPP server will be 5556761234@rlyshw.com
Using your favorite IMing program (iMessage, pidgin, etc.) connect to 5556761234@rlyshw.com after registering in the app.

email me at rlyshw@udel.edu with questions
